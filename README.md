# VBA Stock Market Data Analysis

## Background
As you progress toward becoming a proficient programmer and Excel expert, this assignment offers an opportunity to apply VBA scripting for analyzing generated stock market data.

## Instructions

### Task:
Create a VBA script to analyze generated stock market data. The script should perform the following tasks:

1. **Loop through all the stocks for one year** and output the following information:
   - Ticker symbol
   - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
   - Percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
   - Total stock volume of the stock

2. **Add functionality** to the script to return the following:
   - Stock with the "Greatest % increase"
   - Stock with the "Greatest % decrease"
   - Stock with the "Greatest total volume"

### Solution Levels:
- **Moderate Solution**: Implement the script to achieve the tasks mentioned above.
- **Hard Solution**: Modify the script to enable it to run on every worksheet (every year) at once.

### Additional Notes:
- Utilize conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
- Use the provided dataset `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` for development, ensuring the script runs efficiently (under 3 to 5 minutes).
- Ensure consistent behavior of the script across all sheets.

Completing this challange will help improve proficiency in VBA scripting and data analysis techniques using Excel.
